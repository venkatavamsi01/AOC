Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! Here, I will share my solutions and input files for each day's challenge as we journey through 25 days of festive coding fun.

About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that runs every December( I just discovered this year ). Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released at 6:00am(Sweden time). These puzzles are designed to test problem-solving skills and programming knowledge, making it a fun and challenging way to celebrate the holiday season (but im tryying to build a routine to code daily).

Repository Structure
The repository is organized by day(hopefully), with each folder containing:

AOC#.ipynb: My solution for the day's challenge ( ofcourse its the edited one )

AOC#_Input.txt: The input file used for the day's challenge.
